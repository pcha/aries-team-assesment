Without the burden of legacy code, it integrates easily with current proven business applications and has the flexibility to take advantage of future technologies as they emerge.At 10X ERP, we believe that while your business is complex, your ERP experience shouldn’t be. Legacy providers have created a burdensome, impersonal, and intimidating implementation process with a product that can’t efficiently take advantage of technology innovations to provide a modern user experience.We work directly with you and your end-users, leading your business through its ERP journey rather than farming this experience out to third parties. We’ve highly automated the implementation process so onboarding time (and costs) are reduced by 50% or more.

Developed, and continuously iterated, based on real end-user feedback, we’ve optimized every interaction to be as intuitive as possible, so both time on value-add tasks and user happiness are maximized.We’ve nearly eliminated the need to open multiple windows and click through endless tabs to see or input information - most standard processes are within one, uncluttered, screen. Combined with simple menu navigation, intuitive search bar, light & dark mode, and keyboard shortcuts, users move through the app quickly and efficiently. We also include an in-app support beacon to contact 10X ERP directly, as well as access to product guides and videos. Together, these features reduce new user onboarding time to minutes - not days or weeks.To emphasize the importance of user-friendliness in 10X ERP, we have a <100ms Goal. We strive to reduce each interaction to <100ms, the point where it seems instantaneous to the user. We know end-users interact with their ERP dozens, if not hundreds or more, times per day. By reducing wait time, and optimizing the experience, end-users can perform more than 2 times the tasks compared to their previous system, all while enjoying the experience more!All of 10X ERP’s features are provided as part of a simple, transparent monthly price.
